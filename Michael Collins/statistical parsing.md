## Statistical parsing

**Statistical parsing** is a group of [parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) methods within [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). The methods have in common that they associate [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar) rules with a probability. Grammar rules are traditionally viewed in [computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics) as defining the valid sentences in a language.

Most statistical parsing algorithms are based on a modified form of [chart parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_parsing). The modifications are necessary to support an extremely large number of grammatical rules and therefore search space, and essentially involve applying classical [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) algorithms to the traditionally exhaustive search. Some examples of the optimisations are only searching a likely subset of the search space ([stack search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_search)), for optimising the search probability ([Baum-Welch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum-Welch_algorithm)) and for discarding parses that are too similar to be treated separately ([Viterbi algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm)).
