### Context-Free Grammars

$N$ is a finite set of non-terminal symbols.

$\Sigma$ is a finite set of terminal symbols.

$R$ is a finite set of rules of the form $X \to Y_1Y_2...Y_n$, where $X \in N$, $n \geq 0$, and $Y_i \in (N  \cup \Sigma)$ for $i=1...n$.

### Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars(PCFGs)

### Ambiguity

It is not uncommon for a moderate-length sentence (say 20 or 30 words in length) to have hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of possible parses.



### The CKY algorithm

The CKY algorithm is a dynamic-programming algorithm.

> question: what's difference between viterbi algorithm and cky algorithm?





==Notes==: This chapter is very difficult to understand especially for the algorithm! But the example is very clear!
