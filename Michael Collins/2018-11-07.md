### Context-Free Grammars

$N$ is a finite set of non-terminal symbols.

$\Sigma$ is a finite set of terminal symbols.

$R$ is a finite set of rules of the form $X \to Y_1Y_2...Y_n$, where $X \in N$, $n \geq 0$, and $Y_i \in (N  \cup \Sigma)$ for $i=1...n$.

### Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars(PCFGs)

Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars(PCFGs), also known as the Stochastic Context-Free Grammars(SCFGs), first proposed by Booth(1969).

### Ambiguity

It is not uncommon for a moderate-length sentence (say 20 or 30 words in length) to have hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of possible parses. <br>

**Structural ambiguity**, which arises from many commonly used rules in phrase-structure grammars. Structural ambiguity comes in many forms.Two common kinds of ambiguity are **attachment ambiguity** (such as, PP-attachment) and **coordination ambiguity** (besides, noun-phrase bracketing ambiguity).

### Long-Distance Dependencies

PCFGs can be applied both to disambiguation in syntactic parsing and to word prediction in language modeling (Special useful in long-distance dependencies).

### The CKY algorithm

The CKY (Cocke-Kasami (1965)-Younger (1967)) algorithm is a dynamic-programming algorithm.

> question: what's difference between viterbi algorithm and cky algorithm?





==Notes==: This chapter is very difficult to understand especially for the algorithm! But the example is very clear!
