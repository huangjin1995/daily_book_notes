### Challenges in machine translation

Lexical Ambiguity

Differing Word Orders

Syntactic Structure is not Preserved Across Translations

Syntactic Ambiguity Causes Problems

Pronoun Resolution

### Classical machine translation 

#### Rule-based approachs

Drawbacks:

1. translation word by word

2. very little analysis of the source text

   difficult or impossible to capture long-range reorderings

   words are translated without disambiguation of their syntactic role

3. after the words are translated, simple reordering rules are applied

4. relies on a large bilingual directionary. For each word in the source language, the dictionary specifies a set of rules for translating that word

#### Transfer-based approachs

Three phrases in translation:

$\blacktriangleright$ Analysis: Analyze the source language sentence

$\blacktriangleright$ Transfer: Convert the source-language parse tree to a target-language parse tree

$\blacktriangleright$ Generation: Convert the target-language parse tree to an output sentence

#### Interlingua-based approachs
