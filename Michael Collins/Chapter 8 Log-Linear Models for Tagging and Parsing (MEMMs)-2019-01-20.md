## Log-Linear Models for Tagging (MEMMs)

### What's MEMMs?

Log-linear tagging models are sometimes referred to as "maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs)"[^1].

The name MEMM was first introduced by McCallum et al, (2000).

## Log-Linear Models for History-Based Parsing











# chapter 8 (CRF)

## Log-Linear Models, MEMMs, and CRFs

### how to define the global feature vector about CRFs?



# Question

### What's maximum entropy models :question: 

For the models which maximum the entropy, that will be lots of models!



### What's the difference between CRF and MEMMs :question:



### what's the process of training data to  algorithm estimation and finally sentence prediction :question:



### CRF/MEMMs​ is the combination of generation model and condition model:question:

It combines the advantages of these two kinds of models :question:

The advantages of generation model (such as, HMMs) is assumption (such as, Markov assumption) or decoding algorithm :question:





[^1]: 1) log-linear models are also referred to as maximum entropy models, as it can be shown in the un-regularized case that the maximum likelihood-estimates maximize an entropic measure subject to certain linear constraints;    2) MEMMs make a Markov assumption.
