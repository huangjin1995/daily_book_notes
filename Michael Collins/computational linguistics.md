## Summary

Computational linguistics is always aims to **find** or **create** the best representation of sentence for each tasks, which is more easier understand by computers! <br>(You can choose the suitable label schemes, such as BIOES labeling scheme.)

| representation           | suitable task                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| named entity recognition |                                                   |

| dependency parser        |                                                   |
| constituency parser      |                                                   |
