## Log-Linear Models


$$
p(y|x;v) =\frac{exp(v \cdot f(x,y))}{\sum_{y' \in \cal{Y}}{exp(v \cdot f(x, y'))}}
$$



### Features of LPCFGs

1. With less restriction, it mean more flexible to incorporate a broad set of contextual information.

we often use features templates to define features, and each features are indicator functions. <br>These features includes uni-grams, bi-grams, tri-grams, skip-bi-grams, prefix, suffix, and so on.

2. More accurate, but with more parameter, it mean need more data to estimate! It will face with data sparsity problem too (how handle it :question:)
