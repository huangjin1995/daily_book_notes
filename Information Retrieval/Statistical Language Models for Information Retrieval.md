Statistical Language Models for Information Retrieval A Critical Review, ChengXiang Zhai, 2008

## Problem Definition 

How to seeking an optimal scoring function (retrieval function)?

A retrieval function is based on a retrieval model, which formalizes the notion of relevance
and enables us to derive a retrieval function that can be computed to score and rank documents.

## language modeling approaches

Ponte and Croftâ€™s pioneering paper published in ACM SIGIR 1998.

### why language models are effective?

why these language models are effective and why they can be justified based on relevance.



## Application

crosslingual retrieval, distributed IR, expert finding, passage retrieval, web search, genomics retrieval, topic tracking, and subtopic retrieval.
