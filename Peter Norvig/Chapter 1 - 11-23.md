## Chapter 1

### The history of artificial intelligence

+ The gestation of AI (1943-1955)

  Alan Turing's vision. 

  He introduced the Turing Test, machine learning, genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning.

+ The birth of AI (1956)

  The Dartmouth workshop.

  It introduce all the major figures to each other.

+ Early enthusiasm, great expectations (1952-1969)

  Newell and Simon (1976) formulate the famous **physical symbol system** hypothesis, which states that "a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action."

  ...

+ A dose of reality (1966-1973)

  The first kind of difficulty arose because most early programs knew nothing of their subject matter; they succeeded by means of simple syntactic manipulations.

  (Such as dictionary-based method in machine translation)

  The second kind of difficulty was the intractability of many of the problems that AI was attempting to solve.

  (Such as solve problems by trying out different combinations of steps until the solution was found - "combinatorial explosion")

  The third kind of difficulty was some fundamental limitations on the basic structures being used to generate intelligent behavior.

  (Such as Minsky and Papert's book Perceptrons (1969) proved that a two-input perceptron could not be trained to recognize when its two inputs were different, but the new back-propagation learning algorithms for multilayer networks was discovered first in 1969 (Bryson and Ho, 1969).)

+ Knowledge-based systems: The key to power? (1969-1979)

  Feigenbaum and others at Stanford began the Heuristic Programming Project (HPP) to investigate the extent to which the new methodology of **expert systems** could be applied to other areas of human expertise.

  The widespread growth of applications to real-world problems caused a concurrent increase in the demands for **workable knowledge representations schemes**. ???

+ AI becomes an industry (1980-present)
