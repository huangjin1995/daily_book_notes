### challenge

+ for long tail and newly emerging <u>entities</u> that have few or no links associated with them.
+ 



### Tools

+ YODIE: Yet another Open Data Information Extraction system [site](https://gate.ac.uk/applications/yodie.html)



### Competition

+ the TAC-KBP track

  http://www.nist.gov/tac/about/index.html

  The Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track conducted as part of NIST Text Analysis Conference (TAC) is an international entity linking competition held every year since 2009. Entity linking is regarded as one of the two subtasks in this track.
