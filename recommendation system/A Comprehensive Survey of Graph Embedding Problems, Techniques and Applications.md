### Challenges

#### Sparsity







### Application

#### Node Related Applications

##### Node Clustering

1. the traditional clustering algorithms can then be applied on the node embedding

2. Jointly optimize clustering and graph embedding in one objective to learn a clustering-specific node representation

##### Node Recommendation/Retrieval/Ranking

entity ranking
