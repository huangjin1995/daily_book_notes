### Computational linguistics

**Computational linguistics** is an [interdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinary) field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) from a computational perspective, as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions.

##### Structural approaches

In order to create better computational models of language, an understanding of languageâ€™s structure is crucial.

##### Production approaches

Comprehension is only half the problem of communication. The other half is how a system produces language.

In an effort to improve computer translation, several models have been compared, including [hidden Markov models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_models), smoothing techniques, and the specific refinements of those to apply them to verb translation.[[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics#cite_note-26) The model which was found to produce the most natural translations of [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language) and [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) words was a refined alignment model with a first-order dependence and a fertility model [16]. They also provide efficient training algorithms for the models presented, which can give other scientists the ability to improve further on their results.

#### subfields

- [Computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) of natural language, largely modeled on [automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory), with the application of [context-sensitive grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_grammar) and [linearly bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_bounded_automaton) [Turing machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).

- [Computational semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semantics) comprises defining suitable logics for [linguistic meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_meaning) representation, automatically constructing them and reasoning with them

- Design of [parsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser) or [chunkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_chunking) for [natural languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language)

- Design of taggers like [POS-taggers (part-of-speech taggers)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging)

- [Machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation) as one of the earliest and most difficult applications of computational linguistics draws on many subfields.

  In order to translate one language into another, it was observed that one had to understand the [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar) of both languages, including both [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)) (the grammar of word forms) and [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax)(the grammar of sentence structure). In order to understand syntax, one had to also understand the [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics) and the [lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon) (or 'vocabulary'), and even something of the [pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics) of language use. Thus, what started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into an entire discipline devoted to understanding how to represent and process natural languages using computers.
