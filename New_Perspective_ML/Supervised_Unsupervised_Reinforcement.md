 “Yann Lecun's Cake”, which he presented at NIPS 2016: “if machine learning is a cake, then unsupervized learning is the actual cake, supervized learning is the icing, and RL is the cherry on the top.” Supervized learning has been very helpful to us, and will continue to be; RL gives machine the potential to surpass human; unsupervized learning builds up the foundation to both of them, and is really the next big thing for AI research.



### Supervised Learning

Challenges:<br>1, machine are constrained to strategies which human already know (but we always know little compared to the world), because they are just imitating. (Supervised Data)



### Reinforcement Learning

Advantages:<br>1, It can freely explore all kinds of strategies which human didn't know,  gives machine the potential of surpassing human.

Challenges:<br>1, There need to be a space of strategies for the machine to explore,  the search is futile if the space is poorly designed. (search space)<br>2, Efficiency in model optimization is poor even for problems with well defined search spaces (e.g. semantic parsing). The reward function is crucial (it strengthens (reinforces) strategies which leads to reward). (feedback signal)<br>



### Unsupervised Learning

Advantages:<br>1,  It tries to explain the world itself--by predicting all the observations that it has access to, and it give good **representations** of the world.<br>2, A good representation makes supervized learning dramatically easier. 

Challenges:<br>1, discovering new model structures which give good representations.
